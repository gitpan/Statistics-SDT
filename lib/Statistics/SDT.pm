Statistics::SDT - Signal detection theory (SDT) measures of sensitivity and response-bias

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The following is based on example data from Stanislav & Todorov (1999), and Alexander (2006), with which the module's results agree.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Signal Detection Theory (SDT) measures of sensitivity and response-bias, e.g., I<d'>, I<A'>, I<c>. For any particular analysis, you go through the stages of (1) creating the SDT object (see L<new|new>), (2) initialising the object with relevant data (see L<init|init>), and then (3) calling the statistic you want, with any statistic-specific arguments.

=head1 KEY NAMED PARAMS

The following named parameters need to be given as a hash or hash-reference: either to the L<new|new> constructor method, L<init|init>, or into each measure-function. To calculate the hit-rate, you need to feed the (i) count of hits and signal_trials, or (ii) the counts of hits and misses, or (iii) the count of signal_trials and misses. To calculate the false-alarm-rate, you need to feed (i) the count of false_alarms and noise_trials, or (ii) the count of false_alarms and correct_rejections, or (iii) the count of noise_trials and correct_rejections. Or you supply the hit-rate and false-alarm-rate. Or see L<dc2hr|dc2hr> and L<dc2far|dc2far> if you already have the measures, and want to get back to the rates.

=over 4

=item hits

The number of hits.

=item false_alarms

The number of false alarms.

=item signal_trials

The number of signal trials. The hit-rate is derived by dividing the number of hits by the number of signal trials.

=item noise_trials

The number of noise trials. The false-alarm-rate is derived by dividing the number of false-alarms by the number of noise trials.

=item states

The number of response states, or "alternatives", "options", etc.. Default = 2 (for the classic signal-detection situation of discriminating between signal+noise and noise-only). If the number of alternatives is greater than 2, when calling L<sens|sens>, Smith's (1982) estimation of I<d'> is used (otherwise Alexander's) - see L<forced_choice|forced_choice>.

=item correction

Supply a rich-boolean to indicate whether or not to perform a correction on the number of hits and false-alarms when the hit-rate or false-alarm-rate equals 0 or 1 (due, e.g., to strong inducements against false-alarms, or easy discrimination between signals and noise). This is relevant to all functions that make use of the I<inverse phi> function (all except I<aprime> option with L<sens|sens>, and the I<griers> option with L<bias|bias>). As C<ndtri> must die with an error if 0 or 1 is given to its evaluation, there is a default correction.

If C<correction> is set to zero, no correction is performed to calculation of rates. This should only be used when you are using (1) the parametric measures and are absoultely sure that the rates are not at the extremes of 0 and 1; or (2) you will only use the nonparametric algorithms (I<aprime> and I<griers>).

If C<correction> is set to 1, extreme rates (of 0 and 1) are replaced with the number of signal/noise trials, moderated by a value of 0.5 (specifically, where I<n> = number of signal or noise trials: 0 is replaced with 0.5 / I<n>; 1 is replaced with (I<n> - 0.5) / I<n>). This is the most common method of handling extreme rates (Stanislav and Todorov, 1999) but it might bias sensitivity measures and not be as satisfactory as the loglinear transformation applied to all hits and false-alarms, as follows.

If C<correction> is set to greater than 1, the loglinear transformation is applied, i.e., 0.5 is added to both the number of hits and false-alarms, and 1 is added to the number of signal and noise trials. This adjustment is made irrespective of the extremity of the rates themselves.

To avoid errors thrown by the C<ndtri> function, any values that equal 1 or 0 will be corrected by method (1), if nothing is defined as the value of C<correction>.

=item precision_s

Precision (I<n> decimal places) of any of the statistics. Default = 0, which actually means that you get all decimal bits possible.

=item method

Method for estimating I<d'> when number of states/alternatives is greater than 2. Default value is I<smith>; otherwise I<alexander>; see L<forced_choice|forced_choice> for application and description of these methods.

=item hr

The hit-rate. Instead of passing the number of hits and signal trials, give the hit-rate directly - but, if doing so, ensure the rate does not equal zero or 1 in order to avoid errors thrown by the inverse-phi function (which will be given as "ndtri domain error").

=item far

This is the false-alarm-rate. Instead of passing the number of false alarms and noise trials, give the false-alarm-rate directly - but, if doing so, ensure the rate does not equal zero or 1 in order to avoid errors thrown by the inverse-phi function (which will be given as "ndtri domain error").

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates the class object that holds the values of the parameters, as above, and accesses the following methods, without having to resubmit all the values. 

As well as holding the values of the parameters submitted to it, the class-object returned by C<new> will hold two arguments, B<hr>, the hit-rate, and B<far>, the false-alarm-rate. You can supply the hit-rate and false-alarm-rate themselves, but ensure that they do not equal zero or 1 in order to avoid errors thrown by the inverse-phi function. The calculation of the hit-rate and false-alarm-rate by the module corrects for this limitation; correction can only be done by supplying the relevant counts, not just the rate - see the notes on the C<correction> parameter, above.

sub new {
	my $class = shift;
	my $self = {};
	bless $self, $class;
    $self->init(@_);
    return $self;
}

=head2 init

 $sdt->init(
    hits => integer,
    misses => ?integer,
    false_alarms => integer,
    correct_rejections => ?integer,
    signal_trials => integer (>= hits), # or will be calculated from hits and misses
    noise_trials => integer (>= false_alarms), # or will be calculated from false_alarms and correction_rejections
    hr => probability 0 - 1,
    far => probablity 0 - 1,
    correction => 0|1|2 (default = 1),
    states => integer >= 2 (default = 2),
    precision_s => integer (default = 0),
    method => undef|smith|alexander (default = undef)
 )

Instead of sending the number of hits, signal-trials, etc., with every call to the measure-functions, or creating a new class object for every set of data, initialise the class object with these values, as named parameters, key => value pairs. This method is called by L<new|new> in case you pass the values to it in construction. The hit-rates and false-alarm rates are always calculated anew from the hits and signal trials, and the false-alarms and noise trials, respectively; unless you send a value for one or the other, or both (as hr and far) in a call to C<init>.

Each C<init> replaces the values only of those attributes that you pass to it - any values set in previous C<init>s are retained for those attributes that you do not set in a call to C<init>. If this is not what you want, and you actually want everything reset, first use L<clear|clear>

Optionally, the method also initialises any values you give it for L<states|states>, L<correction|correction>, L<precision_s|precision_s> and L<method|method>. If you have already set these values, and you do not do so in another call to C<init>; the previous values will be retained.

 $sdt->rate('c' => {noise_trials => integer, correct_rejections => integer})  # or false_alarms instead of correct_rejections

Generic method to get or set any rate.

To I<get> a rate, pass only a string that indicates the rate: hit, false-alarm, miss, correct-rejection: only checks the first letter, so any passable abbreviation will do. The rate is returned to the precision indicated by the present value of L<precision_s|precision_s>, if anything.

To I<set> a rate, either give the actual probability as key => value pairs, or send a hashref giving sufficient info to calculate the rate (if this has not already been sent to L<init|init> or one of the measure-methods). 

Also performs any required or requested corrections, depending on the present value of L<correction|correction>.

Unless the values of the rates are directly given, then they will be calculated from the presently sent counts and trial-numbers, or whatever has been cached of these values. For the hit-rate, there must be a value for C<hits> and C<signal_trials>, and for the false_alarm_rate, there must be a value for C<false_alarms> and C<noise_trials>.  If these values are not sent, they will be taken from any prior value, unless this has been L<clear|clear>ed or never existed - in which case expect a C<croak>.

I<Alias>: C<sensitivity>, C<discriminability>

Get one of the sensitivity measures, as indicated by the first argument string, optionally updating any of the measure variables and options with a subsequent hashref. The measures are as follows, accessed by giving the name (or at least its first two letters) as the first argument.

=over 4

=item dprime

Returns the index of sensitivity, or discrimination, I<d'> (d prime), found by subtracting the I<z>-score that corresponds to the false-alarm rate (B<far>) from the I<z>-score that corresponds to the hit rate (B<hr>): 

=for html <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>d'</i> = phi<sup>&ndash;1</sup>(hr)&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;phi<sup>&ndash;1</sup>(far)</p>

=item

In this way, sensitivity is measured in standard deviation units, larger positive values indicating greater sensitivity. If both the hit-rate and false-alarm-rate are either 0 or 1, then L<sens>itivity returns 0. A value of 0 indicates no sensitivity to the presence of the signal, i.e., it cannot be discriminated from noise. Values less than 0 indicate a lack of sensitivity that might result from a consistent, state-specific "mix-up" or inhibition of responses.

If there are more than two states (not only signal and noise-plus-signal), then I<d'> will be estimated by the following.

=item forced_choice

An estimate of I<d'> based on the percent correct in a forced-choice task with any number of alternatives. This method is automatically called via L<sens>itivity if the value of C<states> is greater than 2. Only for this condition is it not necessary to calculate the false-alarm rate; the hit-rate is formed, as usual, as the count of hits divided by signal_trials.

At least a couple methods are available to estimate I<d'> when states > 2; accordingly, there is the option - set either in L<init|init> or L<sens>itivity or otherwise - for C<method>: its default value is I<smith> (this is the method cited by Stanislav & Todorov (1999)); otherwise, you can use the more generally applicable I<alexander> method:

B<I<Smith (1982) method>>: satisfies "the 2% bound for all I<M> [states] and all percentiles and, except for I<M> = 3 or 4, satisfies a 1% error bound". Unlike the C<alexander> method, the specific algorithm is dependent on the size of states. 

For I<n> states E<lt> 12:

=for html <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>d'</i> = K<sub>M</sub>.log(  ( (<i>n</i>&ndash;&nbsp;1).<i>hr</i> ) / ( 1 &ndash; <i>hr</i> ) )</p>

=item

where

=for html <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K<sub>M</sub> = .86 &ndash; .085 . log(<i>n</i>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;1).</p>

=item

If I<n> >= 12,

=for html <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>d'</i> = A + B . phi<sup>&ndash;1</sup>(hr)</p>

=item

where

=for html <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A</i> = (&ndash;4 + sqrt(16 + 25 . log(<i>n</i> &ndash; 1))) / 3</p>

=item

and

=for html <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>B</i> = sqrt( (log(<i>n</i> &ndash; 1) + 2) / (log(<i>n</i> &ndash; 1) + 1) )</p>

=item

B<I<Alexander (2006/1990) method>>: "gives values of I<d'> with an error of less than 2% (mostly less than 1%) from those obtained by integration for the range I<d'> = 0 (or 1% correct for I<n> [states] > 1000) to 75% correct and an error of less than 4% up to 95% correct for I<n> up to at least 10000, and slightly greater maximum errors for I<n> = 100000. This approximation is comparable to the accuracy of Elliott's table (0.02 in proportion correct) but can be used for any I<n>." (Elliott's table being that in Swets, 1964, pp. 682-683). The estimation is offered by:

=for html <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>d'</i> = ( phi<sup>&ndash;1</sup>(hr) &ndash;&nbsp;phi<sup>&ndash;1</sup>(1/<i>n</i>) ) / <i>An</i></p>

=item

where I<n> is the number of L<states|states> (or "alternatives", size of the "alphabet", etc.), and I<An> is estimated by:

=for html <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>An</i> = 1 / (1.93 + 4.75.log<sub>10</sub>(<i>n</i>) + .63.[log<sub>10</sub>(<i>n</i>)]<sup>2</sup>) </p>

=item aprime

Returns the nonparametric index of sensitivity, I<A'>.

Ranges from 0 to 1. Values greater than 0.5 indicate positive discrimination (1 = perfect performance); values less than 0.5 indicate a failure of discrimination (perhaps due to consistent "mix-up" or inhibition of state-specific responses); and a value of 0.5 indicates no sensitivity to the presence of the signal, i.e., it cannot be discriminated from noise.

=item adprime

Returns I<Ad'>, the area under the receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curve, equalling the proportion of correct responses for the task as a two-alternative forced-choice task.

If both the hit-rate and false-alarm-rate are either 0 or 1, then C<sensitivity> with this argument returns 0.5.

# Bias measures:

 $b = $sdt->bias('likelihood|loglikelihood|decision|griers') # based on values of the measure variables already inited or otherwise set 
 $b = $sdt->bias('likelihood' => { signal_trials => integer}) # update any of the measure variables

Get one of the decision/response-bias measures, as indicated below, by the first argument string, optionally updating any of the measure variables and options with a subsequent hashref (as given by example for C<signal_trials>, above). 

With a I<yes> response indicating that the decision variable exceeds the criterion, and a I<no> response indicating that the decision variable is less than the criterion, the measures indicate if there is a bias toward the I<yes> response, and so a liberal (or low) criterion, or a bias toward the I<no> response, and so a conservative (or high) criterion.  

The measures are as follows, accessed by giving the name (or at least its first two letters) as the first argument to C<bias>.

=over 4

=item beta (or) likelihood_bias

Returns the I<beta> measure of response bias, based on the ratio of the likelihood the decision variable obtains a certain value on signal trials, to the likelihood that it obtains the value on noise trials.

Values less than 1 indicate a bias toward the I<yes> response, values greater than 1 indicate a bias toward the I<no> response, and the value of 1 indicates no bias toward I<yes> or I<no>.

=item log_likelihood_bias

Returns the natural logarithm of the likelihood bias, I<beta>. 

Ranges from -1 to +1, with values less than 0 indicating a bias toward the I<yes> response, values greater than 0 indicating a bias toward the I<no> response, and a value of 0 indicating no response bias.

=item c (or) decision_bias

Implements the I<c> parametric measure of response bias. Ranges from -1 to +1, with deviations from zero, measured in standard deviation units, indicating the position of the decision criterion with respect to the neutral point where the signal and noise distributions cross over, there is no response bias, and I<c> = 0. 

Values less than 0 indicate a bias toward the I<yes> response; values greater than 0 indicate a bias toward the I<no> response; and a value of 0 indicates no response bias.

=item griers_bias

Implements Griers I<B''> nonparametric measure of response bias. 

Ranges from -1 to +1, with values less than 0 indicating a bias toward the I<yes> response, values greater than 0 indicating a bias toward the I<no> response, and a value of 0 indicating no response bias.

=head1 LIMITATIONS/TODO

Expects descriptive counts, not raw observations, confidence ratings; this limits the measures that can be implemented: methods C<load> and C<unload> are reserved to implement handling of data lists.

Perl's C<params> modules do not seem to effect the required validation of parameters needed for each measure; the present work-around is obsessive-compulsive, while not exhaustive of all wayward possibilities, and requires optimisation but extension. It is presently quite possible to suffer an inelegant death should anything too unsual, or impoverished of details, be attempted in the life of the module.
